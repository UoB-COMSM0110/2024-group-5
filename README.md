<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
This section explores the design aspects of our game. Thinking about system architecture, creating class and behaviour diagrams, and drawing on the previous information we learned from thinking about requirements, provided a roadmap for development. This ensured we can stay on track with our goals and ensure that the final product is able to meet the intended requirements.

### System Architecture
Reflecting on our game systemâ€™s core design, it was clear that the utilisation of an Object-Oriented Architecture (OOA) was incredibly useful in shaping the collaborative development process. The inherent benefit of OOA is in its ability to provide clear and structured organisation of classes, which assuaged the time wasted in team discussions on clarification of systems (Herbsleb, 2011). On top of helping to streamline collaboration, OOA also allowed team members to focus on their own tasks without affecting the work of others. 

Furthermore, its synergy with the agile development style is of great benefit, as it allowed members to make incremental enhancements to the code. The modular nature of OOA allows for the iterative and adaptive style of development embodied by the agile process (Beck, 2001), which allowed us to address challenges as and when they appeared.
