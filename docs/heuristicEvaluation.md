# Heuristic Evaluation

*How our game fares against Jaokb Nielsen's 10 general principles for interaction design.*

##### (1) Visibility of system status:
>The design should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within a reasonable amount of time

Good points:
- Health points meter.
- Points tally.

Criticisms: 
- There is no tutorial, or narrative. It is not explain that you need to click to keep the spaceship from falling down, or that you have weapons, or how to fire the weapons.
- At the end of a game, the system appears unresponsive when you click "Continue".
<br>

##### (2) Match Between the System and the Real World: 
>The design should speak the users' language. Use words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than internal jargon. Follow-real world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.

Good points:
- It is obvious that the goal is to navigate the spaceship through an asteroid belt. 

Criticisms:
- The text in the background image look like buttons or relevant bits of information, when they don't actually have any meaning.
- When the spaceship moves upwards there isn't a visual representation that explains how/why it is moving upwards, e.g. no thruster, or the angle or the ship doesn't tilt upwards
- The minerals that the user needs to collect look like asteroids that should be avoided
<br>

##### (3) User Control and Freedom: 
>Users often perform actions by mistake. They need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted action without having to go through an extended process.

Good points:
- It is easy to end the game
<br>

##### (4) Consistency and Standards: 
>Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform and industry conventions.

**Good points**:
- It is clear what each button on the main menu does

Criticisms:
- Some areas of the background image/gif look like they are buttons, or they have meaning, or that it is possible to interact with them in some way
- It's not obvious that left click will move the spaceship upwards, as opposed to the 'up' arrow
<br>

##### (5) Error Prevention: 
>Good error messages are important, but the best designs carefully prevent problems from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions, or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.

Criticisms:
- During the loading screen, some people press a key because they think that will allow them to skip it. This causes the game to crash.
<br>

##### (6) Recognition rather than recall: 
>Minimize the user's memory load by making elements, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the interface to another. Information required to use the design (e.g. field labels or menu items) should be visible or easily retrievable when needed.

Good points:
- Relatively low memory load for users, it is a simple game to play, when you know how to.

Criticisms:
- Without a tutorial it is impossible to know how to play. There is no tutorial.
<br>

##### (7) Flexibility and Efficency of use: 
>Shortcuts — hidden from novice users — may speed up the interaction for the expert user so that the design can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.

Good points:
- Being able to set the difficulty level before the game begins would allow experienced players to skip the easy level, which they could find tedious.
<br>

##### (8) Aesthetic and Minimalist Design: 

>Interfaces should not contain information that is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in an interface competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.

Criticism:
- Some areas of the background image/gif look like they are buttons, or they have meaning, or that it is possible to interact with them in some way.
<br>

##### (9) Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors: 

>Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no error codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.

Ciritcism:
- No error messages, e.g. when pressing a key during the loading screen, when clicking on LAN battle, when you die from crashing into the top of the screen.
- No cursor to represent "loading" state, e.g. at the end of the game it takes a long time for the game to respond to a click on "Continue" button.
<br>

##### (10) Help and documentation: 
>It’s best if the system doesn’t need any additional explanation. However, it may be necessary to provide documentation to help users understand how to complete their tasks.

Good points:
- The game is simple enough that it shouldn't need documentation. All of necessary information about the game could be covered in a tutorial.
