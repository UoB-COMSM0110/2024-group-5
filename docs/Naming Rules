The raw rules of naming(refer to java lesson's slide)
no _ in variable name.
1. class name: First letter must be capital, new word must start with a capital eg(class MyClass,class Car)
2. field name: First letter must not be capital, new word must start with a capital
3. method name: First letter must not be capital, new word must start with a capital

remember the variable name must be related to its' meaning(eg. Button btnStart = new Button());
remember to leave comments of ur variables.
