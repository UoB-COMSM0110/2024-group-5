Ming: Hello my friends. To learn processing, I highly recommand u guys to learn libraries and java grammar from several ways: chatgpt, github projects and official documentation, any social media.
1. looking official documentation to start write some simple demo (website address:https://processing.org/reference)
2. looking some tutorials from social media: utube, bilibili(https://www.bilibili.tv/en)
3. ask chatgpt for more details about ur need and certain library.
4. looking others project directly from github(search with keywords:processing and game)
(1)download .zip file
(2)open ur processing and install particular libraries
(3)start from function(setup, which is similar to main in c)and understand basic logic of code.
(4)try to extract anything u want

The purpose of making this file is to share github projects which u think might be useful to our game.
