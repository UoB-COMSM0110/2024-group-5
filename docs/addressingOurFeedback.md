#Things we could do to address the criticisms raised in the user feedback

##We need a tutorial
This would resolve the following issues with users:
- Dying immediately when the game begins
- Not knowing why they are dying
- Not understanding the aim of the game
- Not knowing what each element in the game is
- Not knowing how to play
- Not knowing that you have missiles and lazers
- Knowing which obstacles are good/bad

##Fix bugs
- The continue button (at the end of a game) takes too long to respond
- Sliders are difficult to use
- The image for the cursor is slightly too big, which means that sometimes the user thinks they are clicking on something, but they aren't the cursor is too big.
- Shooting as many missiles as possible can cause the computer to crash.
- Pressing 'z', perhaps other keys too, during the loading screen to crash because a NullPointerException is raised and not caught
- It's not possible to turn of the shield

##Possible new features
- Weapons have limited ammo
- One weapon can destroy an alien, and the other can destroy an asteroid
- The shield has limited life
- Shooting an asteroid could reveal minerals/gems/aliens
- Can use the keyboard instead of the mouse to move the spaceship

##UI improvements
- Change the background on the main menu, the text, labels and animations are misleading
- A cleaner look for the settings menu, a couple of people said that is ugly
- The spaceship has a thruster on it's underside, which fires everytime it moves upwards/replace the spaceship with an astronaut that has a booster pack.
- Make the minerals look less like asteroids, more like gems/something attractive
