#### Think Aloud Feedback

> Alex C.:
- I really like how there are different backgrounds each time
- Fun
- Has potential
- Died quickly, first instinct was to use the keyboard to move
- Confused why spaceship shades out
- Confused about what damages health, e.g. crashing
- Not sure what these white things are (the minerals)
- I need instructions on what the aim of the game is,
- Need the boundaries need to be more clearly defined
- I don't know why I am dying
- I feel like I shouldn't die when I get to the edge of the screen
- Too hard


> Alex E.:
- Aesthetics are pleasing
- Sliders not working properly
- Continue button takes a while to respond
- Unclear how to play the game:
    - what is an obstacle? what is helpful?
- It's not obvious that you can fire weapons


>Freya:
- Looking at the UI and seeing if any of the elements do anything/or if they are just graphics. e.g. is the "System Map" a button
- The UI for the setting menu clashes/unaesthetic
- "Continue" button when you die  doesn't do anything
- Unclear how to move
- The physics don't feel realistic, shouldn't fall in space
- Too many obstacles, which are too hard to avoid
- It needs to be clearer which obstacles are good/bad
- We need a tutorial
- Force field needs a battery/life line, it makes the game too easy if left unchecked
- Thruster needs to be on the bottom of the ship
- It's need to be more obvious what happens when crashes happen, e.g. a shake/path of spaceship changes
- Too many obstacles, the screen is too crowded


>Kelvin:
- The accuracy of the cursor is off
- Shooting too many missiles can break the computer 
- Pressing 'z' during the loading screen causes a NullPointerException


>Josh:
- Not informed
- Didn't know how the controls worked, no tutorial
- It's not clear that the top and bottom are boundaries
- Not clear you need to collect the minerals - not sure which obstacles weere good/bad
- Opening and starting the game was fine.
- There are bugs, but no helful ways to recover
- Really cool design, nice vibe :) Nice music
- Weapons are fun, laser could be limited
- Felt like there were a few situations where there wasn't a safe route at all,
- Fun to play
- Should be an explosion when you die/crash


>Sophie:
- Unclear direction
- Mismatched aesthetic

>Pete:
- Too hard to start with 
- Fun once I understood the game
- The spaceship should have a thrust on it's underside that fires when you click to move
the ship upwards
- pressing a key during the loading screen causes the game to crash
- game works better with keyboard, not mouse
