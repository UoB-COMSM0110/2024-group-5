Josh:
1. Not informed
Didn't know how the controls worked, no tutorial
It's not clear that the top and bottom are boundaries
Not clear you need to collect the minerals - not sure which obstacles weere good/bad


Opening and starting the game was fine.


There are bugs, but no helful ways to recover

Really cool design, nice vibe :) Nice music
Weapons are fun, lasercould be limited

Felt like there were a few situations where there wasn't a safe route at all,
Fun to play

Should be an explosion when you die/crash


Sophie:
I have no idea what I'm doing
I don't know what any of the things are
Why there is a sword
The aeasthetic is mis-matched, and confusing


#TA Alex:
Sliders are an issue

Continue button to a while to respond

Aesthetics are pleasing

It's not clear how to play the game, what is an obstalce, what is helpful

It's not obvious that you can fire weapons
#Alex:
- Died quickly, first instinct was to use the keyboard to move
- Confused why spaceship shades out
- Confused about what damages health, e.g. crashing
- I really like how there are different backgrounds each time
- Not sure what these white things are (the minerals)
- I need instructions on what the aim of the game is,
- Need the boundaries need to be more clearly defined
- I don't know why I am dying
- I feel like I shouldn't die when I get to the edge of the screen
- It would be helpful if I could shoot
- I have to say I think it is too hard, more than a few seconds

#Freya:
- Looking at the UI and seeing if any of the elements do anything/or if they are just graphics. e.g. is the "System Map" a button
- The UI for the setting menu is ugly
- "Continue" button when you die  doesn't do anything
- How do I move?? Oh when I click I go up, it's like flappy birds
- The physics don't feel realistic, shouldn't fall in space
- Fewer harder to dodge obstacles would be good
- It needs to be clearer which obstacles are good/bad
- We need a tutorial
- Force field needs a battery/life line, it is OP atm
- Thruster needs to be on the bottom
- It's need to be more obvious what happens when crashes happen, e.g. a shake/path of spaceship changes
- Too many obstacles, the screen is too crowded
- One weapon can destroy the asteroid
- Other weapon can destroy opponent

#Kelvin:
- The accuracy of the cursor is off
- Shooting too many missiles can break the computer
- Pressing 'z' during the loading screen causes a NullPointerException
